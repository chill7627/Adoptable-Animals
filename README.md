# Adoptable-Animals
### OVERVIEW

Many animals wind up in shelters for various reasons.  Some get adopted, some donâ€™t, and some even die in shelters.  By looking at intake and outake data and statistics, I can attempt to predict which animals cats and dogs, breed, sex, health, etc. tend to get adopted.  With this information and prediction capability, the animals that need a little more attention to get adopted can receive the extra time and attention needed to get them adoption ready.  

As an extra layer, most dogs that come into shelter are mixed breed.  The breed of a dog is a major factor in whether it will be adopted.  A dogs breed and breed mixture can be determined from intake photographs.  This will help to increase accuracy in intake documentation and resultantly positively affect the result of the adoption prediction.

All this will lead to better awareness and hopefully help find homes for the animals that need it the most.

### Data Wrangling
The first step in being able to look into animal adoptions and dog breed classification is to gather, organize, and clean the data.  This is done in the [Adoptable Animals Data Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/chill7627/Adoptable-Animals/blob/master/IPYNBs/Adoptable%20Animals%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb).

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The second step is taking a first look and digging in the data that was just wrangled to get an idea of the big picture that the data presents.  Also, to dig in a little into the details to see if any insights or interesting finds pop out in the exploratory analysis.  This is done in the [Adoptable Animals Exloratory Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/chill7627/Adoptable-Animals/blob/master/IPYNBs/Adoptable%20Animals%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).
